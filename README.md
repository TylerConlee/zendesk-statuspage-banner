# zendesk-statuspage-banner
Utilizes the structure of [moderatorwes/Notification-Banner](https://github.com/moderatorwes/Notification-Banner)

Replace the `<YOUR_STATUSPAGE_ID_HERE>` on line 8 with your StatusPage ID. This can be found at `https://link-to-your-statuspage.com/api`

Paste this snippet into your JS file in your Zendesk Guide theme. Combined with the CSS from `moderatorwes/Notification-Banner`, this banner only shows when you have an unresolved incident on your StatusPage.

Future plans:
- List affected components
- Customize CSS
